    /*You wanna be the very best pokemon trainer, like no one ever was, so you set out to catch pokemons.
    Define a class Trainer and a class Pokemon. Trainer has a name, number of badges and a collection of pokemon.
    Pokemon has a name, an element and health, all values are mandatory. Every Trainer starts with 0 badges.
    From the console you will receive an unknown number of lines until you receive the command "Tournament",
    each line will carry information about a pokemon and the trainer who caught it in the format
    "<TrainerName> <PokemonName> <PokemonElement> <PokemonHealth>" where TrainerName is the name of the Trainer
    who caught the pokemon, names are unique there cannot be 2 trainers with the same name. After receiving the
    command "Tournament" an unknown number of lines containing one of three elements "Fire", "Water", "Electricity"
    will follow until the command "End" is received. For every command you must check if a trainer has at
        least 1 pokemon with the given element, if he does he receives 1 badge, otherwise all his pokemon lose 10
    health, if a pokemon falls to 0 or less health he dies and must be deleted from the trainerâ€™s collection.
    After the command "End" is received you should print all trainers in the format "<TrainerName> <Badges> <NumberOfPokemon".
